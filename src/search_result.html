              I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in
              Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive
              from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a
              short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua
              Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in
              Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back.
